# Signal Processing Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various signal processing techniques, with a focus on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis for denoising purposes.

## Contents

The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. `fast-fourier-transform-fft-denoising.ipynb`: Demonstrates the use of FFT for signal denoising. [FFT](https://github.com/grep265/signal-processing/blob/main/fast-fourier-transform-fft-denoising.ipynb)
2. `fft-vs-wavelet-transform-denoising.ipynb`: compares FFT vs wavelet transform for noise reduction in signals.  [FFT-vs-Wavelet](https://github.com/grep265/signal-processing/blob/main/fft-vs-wavelet-transform-denoising.ipynb)
